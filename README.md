# NLTKEffectiveBusineesCommunication
The idea is to input a paragraph of text and flag the following(Reference: TRW Slides, On Effective Writing): 
1. Clich√©s (Hard)
2. Excessive use of jargons (Hard)
3. Redundancy and circumlocution (Medium)
4. Foreign words and phrases (Easy)
The work will begin with 4 followed by 3 as they are slightly easy to find as they tend to fall a pattern and can be done with high accuracy. 1 and 2 are slightly difficult because they derive meaning from the text and will only work to a certain accuracy but it'll be a good challenge.
Update 1: Foreign Words Filtered
